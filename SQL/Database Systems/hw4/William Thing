1.
	a. YES
	b. YES
	c. NO
		counter-example:
			If R is a table that contains attributes of movie names, movie id, and rankings
			and L = Rankings and K = movie names.
			Π_K(Π_L(R)) will just project L, which will get you a table with only Ranking attributes, and after projecting K will get you nothing because the table only has one attribute which is not K.

			Π_K,L(R) will project a table that contains both attributes L and K, instead of nothing, not the same/equal.

	d. YES
	e. NO
		counter-example:
			γL, agg(A)(γL, agg(A)(R)) if R is a table that consist of two attributes L = movie names and the actors that played in them = A. Then doing an agg(A) like count of employees grouped by movies you would get a table of movies and count of how many actors played in them. But when using the same agg(A) on that table of movies and count you would get nothing because the attribute A does not exist anymore.

			γL, agg(A)(R) if R is the same table R as before where it consist of two attributes movie names and the actors then doing an agg(A) like count of employees grouped by movies would get a table of movies and count of how many actors played in them. Which is not equal to the γL, agg(A)(γL, agg(A)(R)).

2. (see attached pictures in drop box)

3.
a. Write a query that retrieves all employees that have two or more managers. Your query should return the eid's and the names.

SELECT e.eid as ID, e.name as Name
FROM Employee e, Manager m
WHERE e.eid = m.eid
GROUP BY e.eid, e.name
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;

b. An independent employee is an employee without a manager.

SELECT e.eid as 'Employee ID', e.name as 'Employee Name'
FROM Employee e
WHERE e.eid NOT IN (SELECT m.eid FROM Manager m);

c. Retrieve the office of all managers of the employee called 'Alice'. If there are multiple employees called Alice, or if one of them has several managers, you have to return all their offices.

SELECT e2.office as Offices
FROM Employee e1, Employee e2, Manager m
WHERE e1.name = 'Alice'
AND e1.eid = m.eid
AND m.mid = e2.eid;

4. 	B(R) = 10,000
	T(R) = 500,000
	V(R,a) = k
	* ignoring disk I/O operations needed to access the index itself

a. Clustered Index on a:

	B(R) / V(R,a) = cost on clustered index

	Cost of σ_a=0(R) = 10,000/k I/O

b. Unclustered Index on a:
   
   	T(R) / V(R,a) = cost on unclustered index

	Cost of σ_a=0(R) = 500,000/k I/O

c. No Index is used but R is clustered on Attribute a

	B(R) = No Index = cost will depend on number of blocks, since has to retrieve every block

	Cost of σ_a=0(R) = 10,000 I/O
